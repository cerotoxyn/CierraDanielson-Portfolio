# CierraDanielson-Portfolio
My name is Cierra Danielson. I'm currently studying software development. I'm a tech enthusiast, an avid problem solver, and have an unquenched thirst to learn.
I graduated from the MACC and have been in multiple different work settings.
I don't have a portfolio yet, but I'm hoping within the next few months, that will change. 
I'm new to the world of programming languages, so I'm not proficient in any as of yet.
